# Introduction

<div class="mb-4 mt-[-8px] text-xl font-semibold text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-500">
  An open source component set optimized to work with Qwik
</div>

Qwik UI Headless Kit provides a complete set of totally customizable components with built-in structure, behavior, and state. This library serves as a foundation of your design system, providing the missing or non-existent functionality from native solutions.

It gives you, the developer, more time to focus on what matters most, building your awesome app! Apply your favorite styling technology, CSS-in-JS, Tailwind CSS, or whatever floats your boat. Add just a few _ad hoc_ styles or implement a full-on design system, Qwik UI Headless makes it easy.

<Note status="warning">
  Qwik UI is in its **beta** phase - it's like a roller coaster, thrilling and full of
  surprises! Expect new features and some breaking changes until we reach version 1.0. So,
  buckle up and enjoy the ride. üèçÔ∏è

## Vision

In 2024, developers should not have to recreate the same [WAI-Aria Patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/) from scratch. Building custom components is challenging, and developers shouldn't need to reinvent common UI patterns.

Our aim is to ensure Qwik UI is not just an effective, but also a simple, reliable, and flexible choice for developing applications.

Qwik UI Headless is optimized to squeeze every possible ounce of performance out of Qwik _(Like lemonade from lemons that had a run-in with a steamroller.)_ ü•§

## Why Qwik UI Headless?

### The client and the server

Like Qwik itself, Qwik UI is super performant because it renders everything it can on the server

Unlike many other solutions that focus solely on client-side components, Qwik UI takes advantage of the server, the client, and the concept of resumability.

This means that Qwik UI can operate with any meta-framework that supports Qwik, including the full framework benefits. At the time of writing, that includes [Qwik City](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/qwikcity/) and [Astro](https://astro.build/).

### Embracing native first

Qwik values HTML as the source of truth, and this principle extends to Qwik UI components. We appreciate and adopt the excellent work done by the [Open UI Group](https://open-ui.org/) when appropriate.

<div class="mx-[-24px] mx-[-32px]">
  <HeadlessArt class="dark:shadow-dark-high shadow-dark-low rounded-lg border-2 border-white" />
</div>

<br />{' '}

This approach also encompasses future native APIs. Users of Qwik UI might find themselves using components that can be gradually adopted into the native specification. This implies that, eventually, these custom patterns might not need any JavaScript.

> For instance, [Qwik UI's popover component](https://github.com/qwikifiers/qwik-ui/pull/445) uses the native Popover API on supported browsers. The Anchor API is also incrementally adoptable.

## Features

### Unstyled

Qwik UI is a headless library, and comes with zero or very minimal styling. This means the design of your components are completely customizable.

<CodeSnippet name="headless-jsx" />

This is in contrast to styled libraries such as Bootstrap or Material UI, where [styles often need to be stripped](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/05/you-dont-need-ui-framework/) in order to be custom.

<CodeSnippet name="headless-css.css" />

### Accessible at its core

Everyone should have equal access to information and functionality on the web. Every Qwik UI component is designed to follow the [WCAG Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

However, it's a common misconception that meeting WCAG success criteria guarantees full accessibility of your components. Unfortunately, this is not the case.

The ultimate measure of your components' accessibility is user testing. This aspect, often overlooked in other projects, is a high priority for us.

### Developer Experience that matches UX

Many libraries tout their excellent Developer Experience (DX), but this doesn't necessarily translate into a superior User Experience (UX).

Conversely, some packages offer great UX, but fall short when it comes to DX.

One of the benefits of Qwik is its ability to create performant applications without compromising on DX. Our goal is to extend this same balance of performance and ease-of-use to those utilizing Qwik UI components.

Some examples being:

- TypeScript support
- Custom Signal Binds
- Automatic entry and exit animations
- SSR & SSG, SPA, and hybrid support
- Fine-grained lazy loading

## Community Driven

Qwik UI is for the community, by the community. An open source project that would not be where it is without the awesome work of its contributors.

            If you're using `Qwik-React`, `Qwik-Angular`, `@qwikdev/astro`, we suggest incrementally adding Qwik UI components to your application.
            Qwik, built as a microfrontend, allows you to incrementally integrate Qwik UI components into your existing application. This approach reduces migration risk and complexity, letting you leverage Qwik UI's benefits at your own pace.
