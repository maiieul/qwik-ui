# Label

Renders an accessible label associated with controls.

<ShowcaseHero />

This component is based on the native label element, it will automatically apply the correct labelling when wrapping controls or using the for attribute.

For your own custom controls to work correctly, ensure they use native elements such as button or input as a base.

## âœ¨ Features

<FeatureList
  features={[
    'Text selection is prevented when double clicking label.',
    'Supports nested controls.',
  ]}
/>

## Building blocks

<CodeSnippet name="building-blocks" />

### ðŸŽ¨ Anatomy

<AnatomyTable
  propDescriptors={[
    {
      name: 'Label',
      description: 'The root container for the label',
    },
  ]}
/>

## Why use a headless label?

The Qwik UI headless label component keeps focus on the input when double clicking.

The native behavior will try to select and focus the text of the label. This is often times not the desired behavior.

{/* Not caught up to main, but would have an issues prop here from FeatureList */}
